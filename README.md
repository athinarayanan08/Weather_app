# Weather_app

🌦 Weather App (Python)
A simple command-line weather app that shows current weather information based on the city name using the OpenWeatherMap API.

📌 Features
Search current weather by city name

Displays temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed

Uses OpenWeatherMap REST API
 
Clean, beginner-friendly Python code

🛠 Technologies Used 
Python 3

requests library

OpenWeatherMap API


🌤️ Weather App (Mock Version)
This is a simple Python-based weather application designed to simulate fetching weather data for cities.
Since external API access is blocked in some environments (like online sandboxes), this version uses mock data instead of real API calls.

📌 Features
Simulates current weather data for sample cities

Includes temperature, humidity, description, and wind speed

Easy to extend with more mock locations

Works without internet or API key

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mock-weather-app.git
cd mock-weather-app
Run the script

python weather_app.py

🧠 How It Works
Instead of calling an actual API, the script uses a dictionary named mock_data with weather info for:

London

New York

InvalidCity (used to test error handling)

You can expand this dictionary to include more cities or customize the data.

📌 Use Cases
Practice project for beginners

Suitable for coding tutorials or offline demos

Alternative for environments without internet access

📈 Future Enhancements
Add real-time weather API integration (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

Build a simple GUI with Tkinter

Add command-line arguments for dynamic input

Unit testing for validation
